How it works, Tech Integration

The application connects donors (individuals or restaurants with surplus food) to recipients (families in need or shelters) through a full-stack web app. A React frontend provides a user-friendly interface where donors can post food donations and recipients can browse or request food. The Python backend (using Flask or FastAPI) exposes RESTful API endpoints (for listing donations, claiming food, managing wishlists, etc.) that the React app interacts with. All data (user profiles, food listings, claims, wish lists) is stored in a MongoDB database, which offers flexibility for handling varied data (e.g. different types of food items and user-generated content). The system is deployed on Render, leveraging Render’s ability to host the Python API service and the React static frontend, and connecting to a cloud-hosted MongoDB (such as MongoDB Atlas).

When a donor submits a new donation via the React UI, the frontend sends a POST request to the Python API (/api/donations) with details like food description, quantity, pickup location, and time window. The backend validates the data and inserts a new donation entry in MongoDB. Recipients on the other end can query available donations with GET requests (/api/donations?near=ZIPcode or filtered by food type), and the backend will fetch matching entries from MongoDB to return to the frontend. The AI integration comes into play in several ways: the backend can call out to an AI service (OpenAI ChatGPT APIl) to enhance search and matching. For example, if a recipient searches in natural language (“looking for gluten-free meals near me”), the query can be semantically matched to relevant donations (using embeddings or AI-powered search) rather than simple keyword match. The AI service is also used to power a chatbot assistant and to provide recommendations (discussed in the AI/ML section below).

To facilitate shelter drop-off mapping, the system integrates with mapping tools. The donor’s and recipient’s addresses can be converted to coordinates via a Google Maps Geocoding API call, and the frontend can display an interactive map (using Google Maps) showing the location of a shelter or the route for drop-off. For instance, when a donor agrees to deliver to a shelter, the app can show driving directions or distance using the Maps API. The tech stack uses standard JSON/REST communication between React and Flask. We also utilize external APIs or SDKs for specific features: for example, using the Google Maps JavaScript SDK on the frontend for rendering the map and picking a drop-off point, and possibly a service such as SendGrid if we want to send notifications (e.g. SMS or email alerts to recipients when new food is available though for the hackathon this might be simulated rather than live).

The AI components can be packaged as utility functions or microservices invoked by the backend. All secrets (API keys for external services like maps or AI) are kept server-side (as environment variables in Render) to keep the frontend clean and secure. In summary, the tech integration follows a modular approach: React handles the user interactions and visuals, Flask/FastAPI orchestrates data and AI calls, MongoDB persists the information, and external APIs (maps, AI, etc.) enrich the functionality. This architecture ensures the app remains responsive, as heavy tasks occur server-side, and the frontend just updates the UI based on results.

Problem, Target Audience:
A significant portion of food is discarded daily by restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals, while many people in the community struggle to secure their next meal. In the United States alone, roughly 40% of food produced (about 70 million tons) goes to waste, even as an estimated 49 million Americans face hunger. 

The target audience for our solution spans two groups: food donors and food recipients. On the donor side, we target restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, and individual households who often have surplus food. Restaurants and grocery stores, for example, might have unsold prepared meals or products near expiration that are still safe to eat. Households might have excess groceries or leftovers from events/parties. These donors are often willing to donate food but lack a convenient, quick way to find nearby takers before the food spoils. On top of that, these donors can receive receipts that can be used for a tax write off since it qualifies as charity. This not only allows for donors to feel good about themselves but also be rewarded for their donations through tax breaks. The audience includes food-insecure families or individuals, as well as community shelters, food banks, and soup kitchens that need provisions. Shelters and food banks constantly seek donations to serve their communities, and low-income families would benefit from supplemental food sources. However, recipients often lack information on who has surplus food at a given time. By targeting both sides of this exchange, the app aims to bridge the gap: Donors get a simple tool to give away food instead of discarding it, and recipients get timely alerts and a selection of available food items they can claim.

Beyond individual users, the platform could also engage non-profit organizations and local governments concerned with hunger relief and waste reduction. They are secondary stakeholders who might promote the app or use aggregated data to plan food rescue efforts
